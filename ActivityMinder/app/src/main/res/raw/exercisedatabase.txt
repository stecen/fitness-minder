Set up the bands on the sleeves, secured to either band pegs, the rack, or dumbbells so that there is appropriate tension. If dumbbells are used, secure them so that they don't move. Also, ensure that the dumbbells you are using are heavy enough for the bands that you are using. Additional plates can be used to hold the dumbbells down.  If more tension is needed, you can either widen the base on the floor or choke the bands. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.\r\n Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development.

To begin, first place a flat bench or a box behind you.  The flat bench is used to teach you to set your hips back and to hit depth. \r\n\r\nThen, set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting your hips back as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you.  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/52000/53851m.mp4"},{"name":"Behind Head Chest Stretch","rating":"4.7","type":"Stretching","muscle":"Chest","otherMuscles":"Shoulders","equipment":"Other","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Expert","guide":"Sit on the floor with your legs comfortably in front of you.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.

If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

To begin, first place a flat bench or a box behind you.  The flat bench is used to teach you to set your hips back and to hit depth. \r\n\r\nThen, set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting your hips back as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you.  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/52000/53851m.mp4"},{"name":"Band Pull Apart","rating":"7.8","type":"Strength","muscle":"Shoulders","otherMuscles":"Middle Back, Traps","equipment":"Bands","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Beginner","guide":"Begin with your arms extended straight out in front of you, holding the band with both hands.\r\n Initiate the movement by performing a reverse fly motion, moving your hands out laterally to your sides.\r\n Keep your elbows extended as you perform the movement, bringing the band to your chest.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Set up the bands on the sleeves, secured to either band pegs, the rack, or dumbbells so that there is appropriate tension. If dumbbells are used, secure them so that they don't move. Also, ensure that the dumbbells you are using are heavy enough for the bands that you are using. Additional plates can be used to hold the dumbbells down.  If more tension is needed, you can either widen the base on the floor or choke the bands. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.\r\n Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\r\n With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.\r\n Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head.

Think of how the soldiers in the military look when they are in standing in attention.\r\n\r\n\t Go back to the starting position by bending at the knees while simultaneously leaning the torso forward at the waist while keeping the back straight.  When the weights on the bar touch the floor you are back at the starting position and ready to perform another repetition.\r\n\r\n\t Perform the amount of repetitions prescribed in the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  \r\n\r\n\t This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it for a rowing motion instead.\r\n\r\n\t If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: Dumbbells can be used as well though I find the bar version easier to perform.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/52000/53791m.mp4"},{"name":"Close-Grip EZ-Bar Press","rating":"9.2","type":"Strength","muscle":"Triceps","otherMuscles":"Chest, Shoulders","equipment":"E-Z Curl Bar","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Beginner","guide":"Lie on a flat bench with an EZ bar loaded to an appropriate weight.\r\n\r\nUsing a narrow grip lift the bar and hold it straight over your torso with your elbows in.

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\r\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\r\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed.

Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you.  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.  You may use wrist wraps for this exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also use a barbell for this exercise.  Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54031m.mp4"},{"name":"Cable Deadlifts","rating":"7.7","type":"Strength","muscle":"Quadriceps","otherMuscles":"Forearms, Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower Back","equipment":"Cable","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Beginner","guide":"Move the cables to the bottom of the towers and select an appropriate weight.

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\r\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. \r\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull.

Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back  straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar.

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\r\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\r\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.  \r\nImmediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. \r\n The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.\r\n Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.\r\n At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible.

Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54031m.mp4"},{"name":"Elevated Cable Rows","rating":"8.4","type":"Strength","muscle":"Lats","otherMuscles":"Middle Back, Traps","equipment":"Cable","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Intermediate","guide":"Get a platform of some sort (it can be an aerobics or calf raise platform) that is around 4-6 inches in height.\r\n\r\nPlace it on the seat of the cable row machine.\r\n\r\nSit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.\r\n\r\nLean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.\r\n\r\nWith your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs.

If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint.  If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.\r\n\r\nUsing your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale.

If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint.  If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.\r\n\r\nUsing your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart.  Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: \r\n\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.  \r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.  \r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).  \r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs.  This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems.  The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria.  The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other.  If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform. \r\n\r\nFinally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54271m.mp4"},{"name":"Medicine Ball Chest Pass","rating":"5.6","type":"Plyometrics","muscle":"Chest","otherMuscles":"Shoulders, Triceps","equipment":"Medicine Ball","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Beginner","guide":"You will need a partner for this exercise.

Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again.  Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).\r\n\r\n\t Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\t When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\r\n  \r\n\r\nCaution: \r\n\r\n\t It is imperative that if you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter.  If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\r\n\r\n\t For obvious reasons you need to be in full control of the barbell at all times.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/40000/41421m.mp4"},{"name":"Narrow Stance Squats","rating":"8.8","type":"Strength","muscle":"Quadriceps","otherMuscles":"Calves, Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower Back","equipment":"Barbell","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Intermediate","guide":"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes.  To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart.  Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: \r\n\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.  \r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.  \r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).  \r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs.  This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems.  The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria.  The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other.  If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform. \r\n\r\nFinally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54271m.mp4"},{"name":"Oblique Crunches - On The Floor","rating":"7.7","type":"Strength","muscle":"Abdominals","otherMuscles":null,"equipment":"Body Only","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Beginner","guide":"Start out by lying on your right side with your legs lying on top of each other.

Inhale during this phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 2: First Pull Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nLift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale.  Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle.  Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings.\r\n\r\nKeep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar.\r\n\r\nAs the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them.

Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended.\r\n\r\nPlace the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet.\r\n\r\nYour back should be flat or slightly arched, your chest held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted.\r\n\r\nKeep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 2: First Pull Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nLift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale.  Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle.  Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings.\r\n\r\nKeep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar.\r\n\r\nAs the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar.\r\n\r\nKeep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 4: Second Pull Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nInhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes.\r\n\r\nKeep the bar as close to your body as possible.  Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position.  Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement.\r\n\r\nAs the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar.\r\n\r\nContinue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 5: Catch Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.\r\n\r\nOnce the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.\r\n\r\nCatch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.\r\n\r\nStand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 6: Downward Movement Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nLower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.\r\n\r\nSquat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor.\r\n\r\nStart over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/98000/99822m.mp4"},{"name":"Power Partials","rating":"9.2","type":"Strength","muscle":"Shoulders","otherMuscles":null,"equipment":"Dumbbell","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Beginner","guide":"Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.

If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.

Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot  as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the bar on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).\r\n\r\n\t  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.

Tip: For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t  Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf.

Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times.  Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.\r\n\r\nVariations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise.  A calf press machine instead of a squat rack can be used as well as dumbbells with one leg or two legs at a time.  A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well.  You can also perform the barbell calf raise using a piece of wood to place the ball of the foot.  This will allow you to get a better range of motion.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.

If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a wider-than-shoulder-width stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance, and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.\r\n\t Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.  \r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels if you lack ankle flexibility.  \r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).  \r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs.  This variation is referred to as weight belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised but separated platforms that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a wider-than-shoulder-width stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance, and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.\r\n\t Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.  \r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels if you lack ankle flexibility.  \r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).  \r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs.  This variation is referred to as weight belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised but separated platforms that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems. p>","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54591m.mp4"},{"name":"Weighted Bench Dip","rating":"9.2","type":"Strength","muscle":"Triceps","otherMuscles":"Chest, Shoulders","equipment":"Other","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Intermediate","guide":"For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back and another one in front of you.

Set up the bands on the sleeves, secured to either band pegs, the rack, or dumbbells so that there is appropriate tension. If dumbbells are used, secure them so that they don't move. Also, ensure that the dumbbells you are using are heavy enough for the bands that you are using. Additional plates can be used to hold the dumbbells down.  If more tension is needed, you can either widen the base on the floor or choke the bands. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.\r\n Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development.

To begin, first place a flat bench or a box behind you.  The flat bench is used to teach you to set your hips back and to hit depth. \r\n\r\nThen, set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting your hips back as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you.  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/52000/53851m.mp4"},{"name":"Behind Head Chest Stretch","rating":"4.7","type":"Stretching","muscle":"Chest","otherMuscles":"Shoulders","equipment":"Other","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Expert","guide":"Sit on the floor with your legs comfortably in front of you.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.

If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

To begin, first place a flat bench or a box behind you.  The flat bench is used to teach you to set your hips back and to hit depth. \r\n\r\nThen, set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting your hips back as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you.  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/52000/53851m.mp4"},{"name":"Band Pull Apart","rating":"7.8","type":"Strength","muscle":"Shoulders","otherMuscles":"Middle Back, Traps","equipment":"Bands","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Beginner","guide":"Begin with your arms extended straight out in front of you, holding the band with both hands.\r\n Initiate the movement by performing a reverse fly motion, moving your hands out laterally to your sides.\r\n Keep your elbows extended as you perform the movement, bringing the band to your chest.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Set up the bands on the sleeves, secured to either band pegs, the rack, or dumbbells so that there is appropriate tension. If dumbbells are used, secure them so that they don't move. Also, ensure that the dumbbells you are using are heavy enough for the bands that you are using. Additional plates can be used to hold the dumbbells down.  If more tension is needed, you can either widen the base on the floor or choke the bands. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.\r\n Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\r\n With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.\r\n Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head.

Think of how the soldiers in the military look when they are in standing in attention.\r\n\r\n\t Go back to the starting position by bending at the knees while simultaneously leaning the torso forward at the waist while keeping the back straight.  When the weights on the bar touch the floor you are back at the starting position and ready to perform another repetition.\r\n\r\n\t Perform the amount of repetitions prescribed in the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  \r\n\r\n\t This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it for a rowing motion instead.\r\n\r\n\t If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: Dumbbells can be used as well though I find the bar version easier to perform.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/52000/53791m.mp4"},{"name":"Close-Grip EZ-Bar Press","rating":"9.2","type":"Strength","muscle":"Triceps","otherMuscles":"Chest, Shoulders","equipment":"E-Z Curl Bar","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Beginner","guide":"Lie on a flat bench with an EZ bar loaded to an appropriate weight.\r\n\r\nUsing a narrow grip lift the bar and hold it straight over your torso with your elbows in.

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\r\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\r\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed.

Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\r\n\r\nBegin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you.  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.  You may use wrist wraps for this exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also use a barbell for this exercise.  Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54031m.mp4"},{"name":"Cable Deadlifts","rating":"7.7","type":"Strength","muscle":"Quadriceps","otherMuscles":"Forearms, Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower Back","equipment":"Cable","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Beginner","guide":"Move the cables to the bottom of the towers and select an appropriate weight.

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\r\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. \r\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull.

Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back  straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar.

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\r\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\r\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.  \r\nImmediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. \r\n The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.\r\n Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.\r\n At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible.

Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54031m.mp4"},{"name":"Elevated Cable Rows","rating":"8.4","type":"Strength","muscle":"Lats","otherMuscles":"Middle Back, Traps","equipment":"Cable","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Intermediate","guide":"Get a platform of some sort (it can be an aerobics or calf raise platform) that is around 4-6 inches in height.\r\n\r\nPlace it on the seat of the cable row machine.\r\n\r\nSit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.\r\n\r\nLean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.\r\n\r\nWith your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs.

If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint.  If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.\r\n\r\nUsing your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale.

If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint.  If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.\r\n\r\nUsing your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart.  Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: \r\n\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.  \r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.  \r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).  \r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs.  This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems.  The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria.  The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other.  If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform. \r\n\r\nFinally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54271m.mp4"},{"name":"Medicine Ball Chest Pass","rating":"5.6","type":"Plyometrics","muscle":"Chest","otherMuscles":"Shoulders, Triceps","equipment":"Medicine Ball","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Beginner","guide":"You will need a partner for this exercise.

Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again.  Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).\r\n\r\n\t Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\t When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\r\n  \r\n\r\nCaution: \r\n\r\n\t It is imperative that if you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter.  If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\r\n\r\n\t For obvious reasons you need to be in full control of the barbell at all times.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/40000/41421m.mp4"},{"name":"Narrow Stance Squats","rating":"8.8","type":"Strength","muscle":"Quadriceps","otherMuscles":"Calves, Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower Back","equipment":"Barbell","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Intermediate","guide":"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes.  To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart.  Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: \r\n\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.  \r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.  \r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).  \r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs.  This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems.  The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria.  The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other.  If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform. \r\n\r\nFinally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54271m.mp4"},{"name":"Oblique Crunches - On The Floor","rating":"7.7","type":"Strength","muscle":"Abdominals","otherMuscles":null,"equipment":"Body Only","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Beginner","guide":"Start out by lying on your right side with your legs lying on top of each other.

Inhale during this phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 2: First Pull Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nLift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale.  Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle.  Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings.\r\n\r\nKeep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar.\r\n\r\nAs the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them.

Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended.\r\n\r\nPlace the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet.\r\n\r\nYour back should be flat or slightly arched, your chest held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted.\r\n\r\nKeep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 2: First Pull Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nLift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale.  Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle.  Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings.\r\n\r\nKeep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar.\r\n\r\nAs the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar.\r\n\r\nKeep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 4: Second Pull Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nInhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes.\r\n\r\nKeep the bar as close to your body as possible.  Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position.  Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement.\r\n\r\nAs the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar.\r\n\r\nContinue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 5: Catch Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.\r\n\r\nOnce the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.\r\n\r\nCatch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.\r\n\r\nStand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 6: Downward Movement Phase\r\n\r\n\r\nLower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.\r\n\r\nSquat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor.\r\n\r\nStart over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/98000/99822m.mp4"},{"name":"Power Partials","rating":"9.2","type":"Strength","muscle":"Shoulders","otherMuscles":null,"equipment":"Dumbbell","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Beginner","guide":"Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.

If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.

Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot  as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the bar on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).\r\n\r\n\t  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.

Tip: For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t  Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf.

Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times.  Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.\r\n\r\nVariations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise.  A calf press machine instead of a squat rack can be used as well as dumbbells with one leg or two legs at a time.  A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well.  You can also perform the barbell calf raise using a piece of wood to place the ball of the foot.  This will allow you to get a better range of motion.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.

If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a wider-than-shoulder-width stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance, and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.\r\n\t Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.  \r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels if you lack ankle flexibility.  \r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).  \r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs.  This variation is referred to as weight belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised but separated platforms that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle.

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\r\n\r\n\t Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a wider-than-shoulder-width stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance, and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.\r\n\t Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution:  This is not an exercise to be taken lightly.  If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead.  If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations: \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.  \r\n\r\nYou can also place a small block under the heels if you lack ankle flexibility.  \r\n\r\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides.  The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used.  I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats.  (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).  \r\n\r\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs.  This variation is referred to as weight belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised but separated platforms that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems. p>","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54591m.mp4"},{"name":"Weighted Bench Dip","rating":"9.2","type":"Strength","muscle":"Triceps","otherMuscles":"Chest, Shoulders","equipment":"Other","mechanics":"Compound","level":"Intermediate","guide":"For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back and another one in front of you.

Note: This exercise is best performed with a partner as placing the weight on your lap can be challenging and cause injury without assistance.  This will be your starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement.  Forearms should always be pointing down.\r\n\r\n\t Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position while exhaling.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: By placing your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you, the exercise becomes more challenging.

If you are holding the bar properly, it should look as if you have your arms crossed but with a bar running across them.\r\n\r\n\t Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\r\n\r\n\t Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\t Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\r\n\r\n\t Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: This exercise is not to be taken lightly as you are applying a lot of pressure to your arms when lifting the barbell.  It is always a good idea to have a spotter as they can help you keep proper form.  Also, make sure that your back is kept straight as bending it can cause an injury.","url":"http://videocdn.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54601m.mp4"},{"name":"Zottman Curl","rating":"9.1","type":"Strength","muscle":"Biceps","otherMuscles":"Forearms","equipment":"Dumbbell","mechanics":"Isolation","level":"Intermediate","guide":"Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length.
